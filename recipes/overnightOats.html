    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This recipe will teach you how to make a basic overnight oats recipe for
      beginners. You’ll find some topping inspiration with four popular overnight oatmeal flavors
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        ⅓ cup homemade muesli, or ⅓ cup old-fashioned oats plus ¼ teaspoon
        ground cinnamon
      </li>
      <li>1 tablespoon chia seeds</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon almond butter or peanut butter</li>
      <li>
        ½ cup milk of choice for a very thick consistency, or up to ⅔ cup milk
        for a lighter consistency
      </li>
      <li>
        ½ cup fruit (I like fresh or frozen blueberries or raspberries, or
        sliced fresh strawberries)
      </li>
      <li>Drizzle of maple syrup or honey, if desired</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a jar or bowl (a working jar or 1-pint mason jar is perfect), combine
        the muesli (or old-fashioned oats and cinnamon), chia seeds and nut
        butter. Add a splash of the milk and mix the nut butter into the oats.
        Then add the rest of the milk and stir to combine.
      </li>
      <li>
        Top with your fruit of choice. (If you used more milk than ½ cup and you
        want your fruit to stay on top, wait to top the oats until you’re ready
        to serve. If you’re using fruit that doesn’t store well, like sliced
        apple or banana, wait to top the oats until you’re ready to serve.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the lid on the jar and refrigerate overnight, or up to 5 days.
        When you’re ready to serve, add a drizzle of maple syrup or honey if
        you’d like, and enjoy chilled.
      </li>
    </ol>
