    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Sushi can be rolled by hand, but for perfectly formed rolls use a bamboo
      sushi mat. They are available from supermarkets and Asian grocers. Use a
      combination of carrot, green onions and red capsicum as a vegetarian
      alternative to the salmon. Alternatively, use sushi-grade fresh tuna or
      tinned drained tuna combined with Japanese mayonnaise instead of salmon.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 1/2 cups (540g) koshihikari rice</li>
      <li>3 3/4 cups (935ml) cold water</li>
      <li>1/2 cup (125ml) rice vinegar</li>
      <li>2 tbsp caster sugar</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
      <li>6 nori sheets</li>
      <li>200g fresh salmon, cut into 1cm-thick batons</li>
      <li>1 avocado, halved, stoned, peeled, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>Light soy sauce, to serve</li>
      <li>Wasabi paste, to serve</li>
      <li>Pickled ginger, to serve</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place the rice in a sieve. Rinse under cold running water, to remove any
        excess starch, until water runs clear. Place the rice and water in a
        large saucepan, covered, over high heat. Bring to the boil. Reduce heat
        to low and cook, covered, for 12 minutes or until all the water is
        absorbed. Remove from heat. Set aside, covered, for 10 minutes to cool
        slightly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine the vinegar , sugar and salt in a small bowl. Transfer the rice
        to a large glass bowl. Use a wooden paddle to break up rice lumps while
        gradually adding the vinegar mixture, gently folding to combine.
        Continue folding and fanning the rice for 15 minutes or until rice is
        cool.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place a sushi mat on a clean surface with slats running horizontally.
        Place a nori sheet, shiny-side down, on the mat. Use wet hands to spread
        one-sixth of the rice over the nori sheet, leaving a 3cm-wide border
        along the edge furthest away from you.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place salmon and avocado along the centre of the rice. Hold filling in
        place while rolling the mat over to enclose rice and filling. Repeat
        with remaining nori, rice, salmon and avocado. Step 5 Use a sharp knife
        to slice sushi widthways into 1.5cm-thick slices. Place on serving
        dishes with soy sauce , wasabi and pickled ginger , if desired.
