    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Today’s recipe is more of a technique than a recipe – but it’s one that
      all steak lovers should know because it’s easy, worthy of using on high
      quality steaks and also a way to really elevate economical steaks.
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s as simple as this: while the steak is searing in the pan, throw in
      butter, garlic and thyme and baste continuously as the steak finishes
      cooking. The garlic-thyme infused butter does all sorts of wonderful
      things to the steak, seeping into the cracks and crevices, and adhering to
      the crust of the steak.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        1 – 2 boneless ribeye or scotch fillet , 2.5 cm / 1″ thick, approx
        300g/10 oz each
      </li>
      <li>1 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper</li>
      <li>75g / 5 tbsp unsalted butter , cut into 1.25cm / 1/2″ cubes</li>
      <li>6 sprigs fresh thyme or 3 sprigs rosemary</li>
      <li>5 garlic cloves , peeled and smashed to split</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Bring to room temp: Take the steak out of the fridge 30 minutes prior to
        bring to room temperature.
      </li>
      <li>Dry steaks: Pat dry with paper towels.</li>
      <li>
        Heat skillet: Heat oil in a heavy based skillet over high heat until it
        is very hot – you should see smoke!
      </li>
      <li>
        Season: Sprinkle each side of the steak generously with salt and pepper,
        then immediately place in the skillet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sear Side 1: Cook for 2 – 2.5 minutes until you get a great crust, then
        turn.
      </li>
      <li>
        Garlic Butter: Leave for 1 minute, then push steaks to one side and toss
        in butter, garlic and thyme. BE CAREFUL – the thyme will sputter!
      </li>
      <li>
        Baste: As soon as the butter is melted, continuously spoon the butter
        over the steak until it’s cooked to your liking – 2 minutes in total for
        the 2nd side for medium rare (52C/125F, chart below for other doneness
        temps)
      </li>
      <li>
        Basting also renders fat on the side of the steak – use tongs to sear
        the edges at the end if you want it browned more.
      </li>
      <li>
        Rest: Transfer steak to a plate and cover loosely with foil, rest for 5
        to 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve steak with a bit of the butter from the skillet drizzled on top.
